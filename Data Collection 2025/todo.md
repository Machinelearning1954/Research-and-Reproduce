# ML Capstone Project - Step 7: Experiment with Various Models - TODO

This document outlines the tasks to complete Step 7 of the Machine Learning Engineering Bootcamp Capstone Project, focusing on experimenting with various models as per the provided rubric.

## Phase 1: Setup and Framework Development (Current Focus)

- [x] **1.1. Initialize Project Structure and Create `todo.md`**: Set up the basic directory structure and this checklist. (Completed)
- [x] **1.2. Define a Standard Dataset and Problem**: Since no specific dataset was provided, select a standard dataset (e.g., Iris, Wine, or a synthetic dataset from scikit-learn) for a classification or regression task to demonstrate the framework. Clearly document this choice. (Completed - Iris and Wine datasets for classification chosen and implemented in framework)
- [x] **1.3. Develop ML Experiment Framework (`ml_experiment_framework.py`)**: (Completed)
    - [x] 1.3.1. Implement Data Loading and Preprocessing: Create functions to load the chosen dataset and perform basic preprocessing (e.g., train-test split, feature scaling if necessary). (Completed)
    - [x] 1.3.2. Design Model Training Pipeline: Create a flexible function or class structure to train various machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting). (Completed)
    - [x] 1.3.3. Implement Cross-Validation: Integrate k-fold cross-validation into the training pipeline for robust model evaluation. (Completed)
    - [x] 1.3.4. Define Performance Metrics: Select and implement appropriate performance metrics based on the problem type (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score for classification; MSE, MAE, R-squared for regression). (Completed)
    - [x] 1.3.5. Implement Model Evaluation and Comparison: Create functions to evaluate trained models using the defined metrics and to compare their performance systematically. (Completed)
    - [x] 1.3.6. Ensure Reproducibility: Incorporate mechanisms for reproducibility (e.g., setting random seeds). (Completed)
- [x] **1.4. Install Dependencies**: Create a `requirements.txt` file and install necessary Python libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib). (Completed)

## Phase 2: Model Experimentation and Analysis

- [x] **2.1. Select and Implement Multiple Models**: Choose at least 3-4 different types of models suitable for the chosen problem and implement them within the framework. (Completed - Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting implemented in framework and used in experimentation script)
- [x] **2.2. Train and Tune Models**: Train each selected model using the cross-validation setup. Perform basic hyperparameter tuning for at least one model to demonstrate the process. (Completed - All models trained with CV, Random Forest tuned with GridSearchCV in `model_tuning_and_experimentation.py`)
- [x] **2.3. Analyze Model Performance**: (Completed - Detailed in `model_performance_analysis.md`)
    - [x] 2.3.1. Compare models based on cross-validation scores and selected metrics. (Completed)
    - [x] 2.3.2. Discuss model generalization, underfitting, and overfitting based on training and validation performance. (Completed)
- [x] **2.4. Summarize and Present Results**: (Completed)
    - [x] 2.4.1. Create visualizations (e.g., bar charts of model performance, learning curves if applicable). (Completed - `wine_model_comparison_f1_macro.png` generated)
    - [x] 2.4.2. Prepare a summary report or a section in a Jupyter Notebook detailing the experiments, findings, and model selection rationale. (Completed - `model_performance_analysis.md` created)

## Phase 3: Deliverables Preparation

- [x] **3.1. Code Documentation**: Ensure all code is well-commented and follows good coding practices. (Completed - Code in .py files includes docstrings and comments)
- [x] **3.2. Project Report/Notebook**: Compile the results, analysis, and code into a comprehensive report or a well-structured Jupyter Notebook that addresses all rubric criteria for Step 7. (Completed - `model_performance_analysis.md` created and covers rubric items)
    - [x] 3.2.1. Final model has acceptable performance/accuracy for the problem at hand. (Completed)
    - [x] 3.2.2. An automated process was created to test different models, and tune them each one after another. (Completed)
    - [x] 3.2.3. The final model shows ability to generalize well from the training data while being still able to provide good performance according to the performance metric. (Completed)
    - [x] 3.2.4. Learn how to pick the right performance metric for the problem, and how it might impact the results. (Completed)
    - [x] 3.2.5. Learn how to use a computational framework (distributed preferably) to easily setup reproducible training tests for various models. (Completed)
    - [x] 3.2.6. Learn how to recognize which model might be underfitting or overfitting the training data. (Completed)
    - [x] 3.2.7. Learn how to properly cross validate your model, to avoid selecting a particular model based on an apriori random training/test split. (Completed)
    - [x] 3.2.8. Learn how to summarize and present results well. (Completed)
- [x] **3.3. GitHub Repository Preparation (Placeholder)**: While not explicitly creating a repo here, ensure the code and documentation are structured in a way that would be suitable for a GitHub repository as per general capstone requirements. (Completed - Files are organized)

## Phase 4: Review and Finalization

- [x] **4.1. Self-Review against Rubric**: Ensure all aspects of the Step 7 rubric are addressed. (Completed - Covered in `model_performance_analysis.md`)
- [x] **4.2. Finalize Deliverables**: Prepare all files for submission to the user. (Completed - All files are ready)
